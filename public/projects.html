                        <p>
                            Rotten Potatoes was one of my early projects during
                            the initial Covid-19 lockdowns in Spring 2020. With
                            not a lot to do, during this period my family and I
                            watched a movie every night for almost two months. I
                            created a review and ratings site so we could
                            determine our family favourite of the quarantine. I
                            loved this project because it was a lot of fun to
                            work on and I also learned a lot of new skills from
                            it such as more advanced CSS, databases, and JQuery.
                            The current iteration was rewritten with React a few
                            months later as a practice exercise.

                        <p>
                            I built a Connect Four game using React because I
                            wanted to take on the challenge of building both a
                            complicated AI and rule set as well as creating an
                            animated front end for the game. I originally
                            created the AI to work with a separate CLI
                            application but then ported it to work with my
                            JavaScript web app. The AI I wrote myself by
                            learning the MiniMax algrorithm.

                        <p>
                            Joplin is an oper source notes app I became involved
                            with. I was able to get a commit merged on the CLI
                            version of the app where the user was able to scroll
                            through hyperlinks using a certain keybinds. More
                            useful than the actual feature was the knowledge I
                            gained from learning to navigate the code base of a
                            large application. I also learned the mechanics of
                            GitHub and the collaboration process in an open
                            source community.
